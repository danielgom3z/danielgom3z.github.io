Lesly's paper titled **Probing the Interaction between Individual Metal Nanocrystals and Two-Dimensional Metal Oxides via Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy** has been published in the journal [Nano Letters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c04225) 

n this study, we investigated how individual silver nanoparticles interact with two-dimensional tin oxide and antimony-doped indium oxide using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
The results of this study offer new insight into the interaction between metal nanoparticles and 2D materials.
