Our invited contribution to Prof Misawa's Festschrift in [The Journal of Physical Chemistry is now published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c03166).

In it we explored the optical properties of porous porphyrin cages through the use of spectroscopic techniques.
Our findings underscore the potential of highly conjugated cages in optoelectronic devices, photosensitizers, and photocatalysts, given their effective light absorption and energy distribution capabilities.
