The paper titled *Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticle-Decorated Ultrathin SnO~2~ Nanosheets with Superior Ultraviolet and Visible Photoresponsivity* has been published in [ACS Applied Nano Materials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.4c00680)

This was a research project carried out in collaboration with [Nitu Syed](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/861056-nitu-syed) and with [Gus Bonin](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1038162-gus-bonin), an alumni of this lab.
In the paper we created efficient photodetectors by combining liquid metal processing and nanoparticle self-assembly techniques.
