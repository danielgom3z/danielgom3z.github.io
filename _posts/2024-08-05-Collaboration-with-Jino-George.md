A collaboration with Prof Jino George has been published in [The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c01511)

In this study, the team led by Prof George discovered how to create a new class of photo-transistors based on the phenomenon of *strong light matter coupling* which is currently opening the door to a new class of quantum technologies
