I was invited to deliver a talk at [the International Conference of PhotoChemistry](https://icp2023.jp) in Sapporo, Japan.

We took the opportunity to go with [Ueno sensei](https://www2.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/faculty/en/researcher/kosei-ueno) to a Baseball game alongside [Christy Landes](https://chemistry.illinois.edu/directory/profile/cflandes) and [Stephan Link](https://chemistry.illinois.edu/directory/profile/slink)!
