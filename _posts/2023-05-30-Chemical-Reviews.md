Our review on **Molecular Energy Transfer under the Strong Light–Matter Interaction Regime** has been published in [Chemical Reviews](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00702)

In it we provide the reader with a succinct account of the fundamental concepts of intermolecular energy transfer, and how they are modified by strong light–matter interactions. We also summarize recent experimental advances in the area, including in optoelectronic device contexts, and highlight both the potential and challenges that remain in this exciting field of research going forward.

This was done in collaboration with our friends James Hutchison, Inseong Cho and Girish Lakhwani
