## Polaritonics Lab

**Polaritonics** is a branch of science and engineering that aims to bridge the scale and speed gap that exists  between  electronics (manipulation of charge flow: small) and photonics (manipulation of light flow: fast). 

A Polariton is an excited state that is an admixture between an electromagnetic wave (photon) and an electronic excited state in a material (like an exciton, a plasmon).

Our research aims to devise new ways for creating and manipulating Polaritons for applications in energy conversion (renewables), sensing and optics.

We work on [Plasmonics](/_pages/plasmonics.md), and [Quantum Batteries](/_pages/quantum_battery.md).
