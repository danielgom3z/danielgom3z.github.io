## Polaritonics Lab

**Polaritonics** is a branch of science and engineering that aims to bridge the scale and speed gap that exists  between  electronics (manipulation of charge flow: small) and photonics (manipulation of light flow: fast). 

A Polariton is an excited state that is an admixture between an electromagnetic wave (photon) and an electronic excited state in a material (like an exciton, a plasmon).

Our research aims to devise new ways for creating and manipulating Polaritons for applications in energy conversion (renewables), sensing and optics.

We work on Plasmonics, hot carriers and Strong Coupling effects, using theoretical models, nano-fabrication & spectroscopy.
