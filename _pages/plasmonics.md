Plasmonics is a growing field in science & technology that is devoted to the study and applications of a wide variety fo phenomena that originates from the unusual optical properties of nano-sized metals.
While  "bulk" metals like silver and gold have shiny reflective surfaces, suspensions of tiny particles made with these chemical elements have very different optical properties.
The vastly distinct colours exhibited by metal nanoparticles arise due to the excitation of localised surface plasmon resonances.
Surface plasmons are coherent (in phase) collective oscillations of electrons with respect to the lattices of atoms making up metal. Plasmons characterised by the appearance of surface charges that oscillate at optical frequencies. These surface-charge oscillations lead to enhanced electromagnetic fields, which are strongly localised at metal surfaces and interfaces.
