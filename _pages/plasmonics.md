## Plasmonics
It is a growing field in science & technology that is devoted to the study and applications of a wide variety fo phenomena that originates from the unusual optical properties of nano-sized metals.
While  "bulk" metals like silver and gold have shiny reflective surfaces, suspensions of tiny particles made with these chemical elements have very different optical properties.
The vastly distinct colours exhibited by metal nanoparticles arise due to the excitation of localised surface plasmon resonances.

Surface plasmons are coherent (in phase) collective oscillations of electrons with respect to the lattices of atoms making up metal. Plasmons characterised by the appearance of surface charges that oscillate at optical frequencies. These surface-charge oscillations lead to enhanced electromagnetic fields, which are strongly localised at metal surfaces and interfaces.

## What is photocatalysis?

Photocatalysis promises to utilise sunlight, a near limitless source of energy, in useful chemical transformations, including water purification and the sustainable production of industrial chemical feedstocks and fuels, such as hydrogen and methane.

Efficient light-harvesting for these applications requires the development of high-performance materials capable of efficiently absorbing and converting light energy into chemicals.

Metal nanoparticles are excellent absorbers of sunlight, but are not suitable on their own for the conversion of water and CO2 into chemical fuels.

This is because ligands (the molecules which help stabilize these particles) also inhibit their ability to perform chemical reactions at their surface, the most reactive part of a nanoparticle.
