There is an ever-growing demand for energy storage technologies that offer high storage capacity and fast
charging. While it is now clear that quantum technologies can significantly enhance computing power,
communications, and sensing capabilities, there is growing interest in applying quantum mechanical
effects to revolutionise energy harvesting and storage.

We aim to develop a **photo-rechargeable quantum battery**: a device that relies on quantum
mechanical effects termed super-absorption reversible
and super-radiance for achieving ultrafast
charging and discharging of an energy storage
device. These unparalleled speeds could be
advantageous in several applications such as fast EV charging stations. 

However, to date a quantum
battery remains as a thought experiment. 

We are tackling fundamental scientific
challenges that currently hinder the use of
quantum technology for energy storage, to
create the worldâ€™s first quantum battery with accessible charge.
